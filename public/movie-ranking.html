<h1>The Best Movies According to Steven</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bad Boys</h3>
<p>This movie is so fun, you will laugh from the start to the end. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are the BEST</p>

<h3>The Blacklist</h3>
<p>The Blacklist is not actually a movie, but a show. Reymond Reddington is something else</p>

<h3>Sarafina</h3>
<p>Sarafina is one of my childhood movie depicting the story of Apartheid in South Africa.</p>
